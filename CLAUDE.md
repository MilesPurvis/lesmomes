# `CLAUDE.md` - Les Momes (Restaurant)

## The Golden Rule
When unsure about implementation details, ALWAYS ask the developer.

## Application Usage

- This application is used for a restaurant
- The owner should have the ability to modify the menu ideally whenever they want
- We want to have a link to ther reservation through open table
- We also want to have media stream of thier instagram page
- Other than that this is the main functionality of thier site

### Technologies

- Should use react and npm, tailwind. 

## Code Style and Patterns

### Anchor comments

Add specially formatted comments throughout the codebase, where appropriate, for yourself as inline knowledge that can be easily `grep`ped for.
